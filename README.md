Introducing Meerkat

While there are a lot of tools for software engineers for tracking stories, tasks, issues, and bugs, there are very few tools for product managers.

In many cases, product managers have to develop many documents and upload them on a wiki to share them accross an organization.

Meerkat intends to change that :)

Meerkat provides a complete tool for product managers to manage the product life cycle.

Meerkat include everything that a product manager needs to document, track, and share about his product with his team such as:

- Product use cases
- Product requirements
- Product design and architecture
- Product features
- Road map and key milestones
- Releases
- Customer feedback
- Bugs
- Beta testing
- Team members

All those features are provided in an easy-to-use workflow through a Web interface.

Meerkat is developed in Python and HTML using Django (www.django.com).

Meerkat runs on a Web server.
