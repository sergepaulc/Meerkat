# Meerkat Dev

**Introducing Meerkat**

While there are a lot of tools for software engineers for tracking stories, tasks, issues, and bugs, there are very few tools for product managers.

In many cases, product managers have to develop many documents and upload them on a wiki to share them accross an organization.

Meerkat intends to change that :)

Meerkat provides a complete tool for product managers to manage the product life cycle of their products.

Meerkat includes everything that a product manager needs to document, track, and share about his product with his team, and in particular:

- The product use cases
- The product requirements
- The product design and architecture
- The product features
- The road map and the key milestones
- The releases
- The Customer feedback
- The product bugs
- The beta testing of the product
- The team members

All those features are provided in an easy-to-use workflow through a Web interface.
